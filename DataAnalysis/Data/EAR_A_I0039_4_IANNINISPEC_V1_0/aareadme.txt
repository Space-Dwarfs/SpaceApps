The data and associated PDS labels and catalog files are organized into the   
        following directories:                                                
                                                                              
catalog - contains PDS catalog files for the data set, the instrument, the    
        instrument host (which is the spacecraft, observatory, or laboratory  
        where the instrument was located), and a listing of references.
