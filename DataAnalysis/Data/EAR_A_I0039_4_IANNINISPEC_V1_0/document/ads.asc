%B Keck/ESI spectra of 11 Iannini asteroid family members were obtained over visual wavelengths.  The data have been published in Willman, et al. (2008Icar...195...663W)[WILLMANETAL2008].  The spectra show family likeness and are believed to represent young S class surfaces aged a few million years by space weathering, the dynamically estimated collisional age of the family.
