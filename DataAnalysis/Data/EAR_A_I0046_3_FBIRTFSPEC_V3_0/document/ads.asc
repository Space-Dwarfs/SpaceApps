%B The data set contains observations obtained with the NASA IRTF SpeX instrument covering the 0.7 to 2.5 micron near-infrared portion of the spectrum.  The data set archives reduced, calibrated spectra which were obtained and used in Sherry Fieber-Beyer's Ph.D. dissertation at the
University of North Dakota and archives reduced, calibrated spectra subsequent 2010. The research focused on asteroids in a zone centered on the 3:1 resonance. These spectra were used to mineralogically characterize asteroids in this zone in an attempt to identify their meteorite analogs.
