%B This data set contains reduced composite visual and near-infrared spectra of thirty M-type asteroids, observed over the years 2004-2008 and presented in Fornasier et al. (2010).  The spectra were taken with the Dolores and NICS instruments at the Telescopio Nationale Galileo (TNG) in La Palma, with the EMMI and SOFI instruments at the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) in Chile, and with the SPeX instrument at the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) in Hawaii.  The individual spectra from the various instruments used to produce the composite spectra are also included.
